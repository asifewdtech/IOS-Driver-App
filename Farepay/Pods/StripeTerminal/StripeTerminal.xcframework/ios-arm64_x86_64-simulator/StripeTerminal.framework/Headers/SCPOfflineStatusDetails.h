 Returns the number of processed payment intents stored locally as an offline record to be forwarded when
 the iOS device goes back online.

 This count will be nil after calling `clearCachedCredentials`.

/**
 Returns the total amount of processed offline payment intents stored locally. The key
 is the three-letter ISO currency code in lowercase. The amount is provided in the currency's
 smallest unit and matches the unit used when creating payment intents.

 example:
 ["usd": 1980,
  "cad": 2003]

 Use this in your application to be able to enforce custom limits on the total amount
 of payments to be stored offline. To prevent future payments from being created
 while offline, you can use the `CreateConfiguration`s `offlineBehavior` property when
 creating payment intents.

 This will reset to an empty dictionary after calling `clearCachedCredentials`.
