 Protocol for classes to conform to that apply configuration options for discovering readers.

 You should not implement this protocol yourself; instead, use one of the following:

 - `SCPBluetoothScanDiscoveryConfiguration`
 - `SCPBluetoothProximityDiscoveryConfiguration`
 - `SCPInternetDiscoveryConfiguration`
 - `SCPLocalMobileDiscoveryConfiguration`

 Objects of those types get passed into the `Terminal.shared.discoverReaders()`
 method to control which devices get discovered, and how.
