/**
 The updated PaymentIntent after `confirmPaymentIntent` failed.

 1. If the status of the updated PaymentIntent is still `.requiresConfirmation`
 (e.g the request failed because your app is not connected to the internet),
 you may call `confirmPaymentIntent` again with the updated PaymentIntent to
 retry the request.

 2. If the status of the updated PaymentIntent is `.requiresPaymentMethod` (e.g. the
 request failed because the card was declined), you should call
 `collectPaymentMethod` with the updated PaymentIntent to try charging another
 card.

 3. If this value is `nil`, the request timed out, and the status of the
 PaymentIntent is unknown. We recommend that you retry `confirmPaymentIntent` using
 the original PaymentIntent. If you instead choose to abandon the original
 PaymentIntent and create a new one, you should be sure **not** to capture the
 original PaymentIntent.
