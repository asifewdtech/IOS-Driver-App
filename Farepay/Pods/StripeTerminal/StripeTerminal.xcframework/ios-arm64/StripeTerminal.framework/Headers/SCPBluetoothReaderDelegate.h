 Implement this protocol to handle a connected Bluetooth reader's events throughout
 the lifetime of its connection.

 Implementing this delegate is required when connecting to any Bluetooth connected
 reader, such as the Chipper 2X BT and the WisePad 3.

 The provided delegate must be retained by your application until the reader disconnects.

 This update should be installed at the earliest convenience via
 `-[SCPTerminal installUpdate:]`

 Check the `SCPReaderSoftwareUpdate.requiredAt` field to see when this update
 will be a required update. Required updates are installed immediately upon connection.

 This delegate method is most likely to be called right after `connectReader:` but
 applications that stay connected to the reader for long periods of time should expect
 this method to be called any time the reader is not busy performing a transaction.

 The SDK is reporting that the reader has started installing a software update.

 There are two scenarios when a reader's software update can be installed. Some
 updates must be installed immediately, and may be being installed automatically
 during `connectReader:`. Other updates can be delayed, and will be installed
 when your integration calls `installAvailableUpdate`.

 Required updates will only start installing during `connectReader:`. Once your app's
 `connectReader:` completion is called, `didStartInstallingUpdate:` will only fire
 from requests to install via `installUpdate:`.

 Note that required updates are critical for the reader to have the
 correct configuration and prevent receiving `SCPErrorUnsupportedReaderVersion`.
 Updates that aren't yet required are reported by `reader:didReportUpdateAvailable:`.

 @param reader      The originating reader.
 @param update      The `SCPReaderSoftwareUpdate` with an `estimatedUpdateTime` that

 installation if needed. Canceling a required update will result in a failed
 connect with error `SCPErrorUnsupportedReaderVersion`. Incremental only updates will
 have a nil cancelable because these updates can not be canceled.
